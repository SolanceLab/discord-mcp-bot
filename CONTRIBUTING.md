# Contributing

This is a **template repository**, not a collaborative open-source project. It's designed to be forked and customized for your own Discord bot with MCP integration.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Fork** this repository (or click "Use this template" on GitHub)
2. **Configure** your Discord bot token and channel IDs
3. **Customize** the MCP tools for your use case
4. **Deploy** your own instance following the README

## What to Customize

- `src/mcp-server.ts` — MCP tool definitions and server name
- `src/config.ts` — Discord channel mappings and bot behavior
- `.env` — Your bot token, guild ID, and channel IDs
- Tool descriptions and parameters for your specific workflow

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug in the template itself (not your customized version), feel free to [open an issue](../../issues). We'll look at it when we can, but this is maintained as a side project — no guarantees on response time.

## Pull Requests

We're not actively accepting PRs. If you build something cool with it, we'd love to hear about it — but the best way to contribute is by sharing your own bot setup with the community.
